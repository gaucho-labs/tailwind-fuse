"Why Tailwind Fuse?"

When working with Tailwind CSS, it's common to apply multiple utility classes to an element to achieve the desired styling. However, as the number of classes grows, managing and resolving conflicts between them can become a challenge. This is where Tailwind Fuse comes in as the missing piece for seamless class composition and conflict resolution in Tailwind CSS.

In traditional CSS, conflicts between styles are resolved based on the order in which they are defined in the stylesheet. Let's consider an example:

```html
<div class="text-blue text-red">Hello, world!</div>
```

```css
.text-red {
  color: red;
}

.text-blue {
  color: blue;
}
```

In this case, the text color of the `<div>` element will be blue, even though both `text-red` and `text-blue` classes are applied. This is because the `text-blue` class is defined later in the stylesheet, NOT in the html element, and CSS follows the "last rule wins" principle.

This behavior can lead to challenges when working with utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS. With Tailwind, it's common to apply multiple utility classes to an element, and the order of those classes in the HTML can affect the final styling.

This is where Tailwind Fuse shines. It introduces the Fuse utility, which intelligently merges multiple Tailwind classes while automatically resolving conflicts. 

Here's an example of how Tailwind Fuse handles conflicts:

```rust
use tailwind_fuse::*;

// Rightmost class takes precedence
assert_eq!("p-4", tw_merge!("p-2", "p-4"));

// Refinements are permitted!
assert_eq!("p-4 py-2", tw_merge!("p-4", "py-2"));

// Collisions can be complex
assert_eq!(
    "stroke-black stroke-1",
    tw_merge!("stroke-black", "stroke-1")
);

```
